# SpoonsApp
An app currently in-progress that allows users to manage their tasks using the spoon theory approach. Many people with varying conditions run on a 
limited supply of energy every day. They do not always have the luxury of getting many difficult tasks done in a day, and can find it hard managing their
time and energy. Some of us(like myself) may not have those conditions and still feel we have only so much energy we can dedicate to tasks in the day. 
This is where spoon theory comes in. I won't go over too many of the specifics here, but the basis is that one starts a day off with a certain amount of
"spoons"(which are used to quantify energy), and tasks will take a varying amount of spoons away from them. Thus those who utilize spoon theory often use
it to define a number of spoons they have in a day(which can vary) and plan out what tasks they will/can get done on a given day.

My current plan for the app is this: Users are able to create different cateogries defined by an assigned spoon-count, which will be listed on a page. 
Clicking on one of the  categories leads to a page where one may create a list of tasks that will take that amount of spoons. Once one has finished this,
they may then select tasks to place in a to-do list, and can remove tasks as they go. If any tasks are not done, they will be returned to their task lists.
Some advance features would be additions such as automatically putting certain tasks into the daily list every day(such as showering, as they do take up 
spoons for some), and also allowing a user to fix a max # of spoons they have in a given day that the app will then enforce. 

PROGRESS UPDATES:

5-14-2022: The app is currently getting closer to having bare mininum functionality. The inital page has been created, which allows users to add categories
and also delete/reorder them. Each newly added category can send the user to a task list page, where they may add tasks and, just like the inital page,
delete/reorder items in the list.
